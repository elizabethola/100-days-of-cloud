h**100 Days of Cloud**

Welcome to my 100 Days of Cloud journey! This is a personal challenge where I will spend time every day for 100 days learning about cloud computing. I'll document my progress, share what I learn, and provide resources that helped me along the way.

**Introduction**

Cloud computing is a powerful and versatile field, and I'm excited to dive into it. During these 100 days, I aim to learn about various cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. I'll be sharing my daily progress, challenges, and the knowledge I gain along the way.

**My Goals**

Understand Cloud Basics: Learn fundamental cloud concepts and terminology.
Explore Cloud Providers: Gain hands-on experience with AWS, Azure,or Google Cloud
Work on Projects: Apply my knowledge by working on small cloud projects.
Document Everything: Keep a detailed log of my daily learning and progress.

**Daily Progress**

I'll be updating this section daily with my progress and share useful resources for the learning.

I'll be using the roadmap by https://www.madebygps.com/cloudcamp/ tweaked into my own version and research.

**How to Contribute**

If you have any suggestions, resources, or tips that could help me on my journey, please feel free to open an issue or a pull request. Your contributions are greatly appreciated!


Thank you for following along on my cloud journey! I'm excited!.
